## Solution Architecture

> **Note üìù** Solution architecture that is defined through the Design event when following the Pod Delivery Framework. Not all services will be required, use what is defined below as a starting point, add and remove to align with customer requirements.

*Insert diagram created using Lucid Chart and define a high-level summary of the design to meet requirements*

### Service Component 1

*Summary of the component used in solution architecture and justification for design decision to meet requirements*

### Service Component 2

*Summary of the component used in solution architecture and justification for design decision to meet requirements*

### Service Component 3

*Summary of the component used in solution architecture and justification for design decision to meet requirements*

### CI/CD Services

*Details of how CI/CD services will be used in solution architecture  and justification for design decisions to meet requirements*

### Observability Services

*Details of how observability (monitoring & logging) services will be used in solution architecture  and justification for design decisions to meet requirements*

### Network Services

*Details of how network services will be used in solution architecture  and justification for design decisions to meet requirements*

#### Network Flow Summary

> **Note üìù** The below table can be used to detail the network flow that is detailed in the architecture diagram

| **ID** | **Description**                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| FL02   | _Service sends data to AWS S3 using S3 Gateway_              |
| FL03   | _Service calls IdP solution to allow for user authenication_ |

### Identity & Access Management

### Backup Services

*Details of how backup services will be used solution architecture  and justification for design decisions to meet requirements*

### Disaster Recovery

*Details of how disaster recovery is defined for the solution architecture  and justification for design decisions to meet requirements*

### Foundation Services

*Details of how foundation services (NTP, Jump Servers, Proxy, Patch Management etc.) will be designed for the solution design and justification for design decisions to meet requirements*

### Alternatives Considered

> **Note üìù** Talk about all the different design alternatives ‚Äì a combination of different Infrastructure platforms, databases, service frameworks, logical approaches, etc ‚Äì you considered and mention the recommended one which you think will be best suited for this project and why. A table with pros and cons including columns like cost, scalability, ease of use, latency, maintainability, and community support is a good way to judge the best services and platforms to use for this design

### Measuring Success

> **Note üìù** This should give an overview of the outcomes and business value that will be delivered for our customers. This should define qualitative and quantitative metrics where applicable. Eg: By implementing this solution Acme will save X amount of engineering hours by automating X process which will, in turn, enable engineers to focus X amount of time doing X.

### Cost Analysis

> **Note üìù**  When additional costs will be added to a customers cloud bill, the analysis should be conducted and documented to estimate additional costs for the solution outlined in this design

### Future Improvements

> **Note üìù** This section talks about the features which the users can expect in future releases. Talk about different features you plan to roll out and what that timeline can look like.

### Solution Delivery

> **Note üìù** Note: Details for each of the Jira issues and their assignees should be added here. It is said that there is no definition of how many issues need to completed for each event (Discovery, Design, etc.) within the Pod Delivery Framework. This will be dependent on the needs of the Pod and the Customer.

| **Event** | **Jira Issue** | **Assignee** |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Discovery |                |              |
| Design    |                |              |
